# Random-Quote-Generator
 First project created out of the **PHP techdegree** program at Treehouse. The project 
 makes heavy use of **PHP** for all the logic, generation of quotes and even manipulation
 of CSS. I have personalized the project enough to make it my own by turning it into
 an Anime quote generator and adding images. I have gone the extra mile to attemp for exceeded expectations grading.

 # Usage

 Since this project servers an index.php file, you have to make sure you have a server
 install locally in your computer such as MAMP in order for the project to work. Simply downloading
 the project and opening it up in the browser won't work.
